# Bolognese: Clitic Allomorphy in Lexical Selection
Files for analysis of Bolognese clitic allomorphy using Lexical Selection

Here you can find OTSoft files for Rubin & Kaplan (2022), a presentation at AMP 2022. The files included are:

1. 2Priorities_reduced_OTSoft.xlsx: the analysis of clitic allomorphy that adopts multiple Priorties.
2. CategoricalPriority_reduced_OTSoft.xlsx: the analysis of clitic allomorphy that adopts a single categorical Priority.
3. OriginalPriority_reduced_OTSoft.xlsx: the analysis of clitic allomorphy that uses the original formulation of Priority from Mascaro (2007).
4. Text files containing the results of submitting the three previous files to OTSoft's NHG and MaxEnt tools.

OTSoft settings we used:

1. NHG:
  Exponential NHG (this requires OTSoft 2.6 or later)
  Number of learning cycles: 100,000
  Initial plasticity: 0.01
  Final plasticity: 0.001
  Number of times to go through forms: 100,000
  
2. MaxEnt:
  100,000 iterations
  Minimum weight: 0
  Maximum weight: 50
