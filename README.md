Files for analysis of Bolognese clitic allomorphy

Here you can find files for our analyses of Bolognese clitic allomorphy using two different formalisms:

1. Lexical Selection (Mascar√≥ 2007): allomorphs are listed in a hierarchy, and the constraint Priority penalizes candidates that do not use the highest-ranked allomorph.
- We argue that this framework succeeds only if Priority is categorical, or if the grammar contains multiple copies of Priority, one for each set of allomorphs. (Rubin & Kaplan 2022; AMP 2022)
2. Gradient Symbolic Representations (Smolensky & Goldrick 2016): input elements are endowed with different activity levels.
- We argue that this framework permits an account of Bolognese if allomorphs themselves (as opposed to individual segments) are given activity levels. (Rubin & Kaplan 2023; WCCFL 41)
