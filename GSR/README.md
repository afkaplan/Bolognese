#Bolognese: Clitic Allomorphy with Gradient Symbolic Representations
Files for analysis of Bolognese clitic allomorphy using GSRs

Here you can find R files for Rubin & Kaplan (2023), a presentation at WCCFL 41. The files included are:

1. inputs_candidates.R: this specifies, for each input, the candidates to be considered and their constraint violations.  Put activities here.
2. NoisyHG.R: this file runs NHG.  Put constraint weights here.

To use these files, first run inputs_candidates.R, then run NoisyHG.R.
